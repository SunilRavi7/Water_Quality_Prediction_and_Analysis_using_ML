# Water_Quality_Prediction_and_Analysis_using_ML
The project predicts water potability using machine learning, classifying samples as safe or unsafe for drinking. It uses features like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity to enhance prediction accuracy.
