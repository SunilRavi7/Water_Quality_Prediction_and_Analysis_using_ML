## **üåü Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting water potability using **machine learning** techniques. It classifies water samples as **safe** or **unsafe** for drinking based on various chemical properties. Key features used in this model include:

- **pH Level**: Indicates the acidity or alkalinity of water.
- **Hardness**: Measures the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions.
- **Solids**: Represents the total dissolved solids in water.
- **Chloramines**: Amount of disinfectant used to treat drinking water.
- **Sulfate**: A chemical compound found naturally in some drinking water supplies.
- **Conductivity**: Indicates the water's capability to pass electrical flow.
- **Organic Carbon**: Amount of carbon found in organic compounds in water.
- **Trihalomethanes**: A by-product of chlorine disinfection of water.
- **Turbidity**: Measure of the cloudiness or haziness in water.

The model integrates various classifiers to enhance prediction accuracy, ensuring reliable water safety analysis.
